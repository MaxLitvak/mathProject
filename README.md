This is a simulation of two blocks of different mass and velocity colliding on a frictionless floor and with purely
elastic collisions which means that no energy is lost among during collisions. The main class is piCollisions which runs the
simulation with the help of the Blocks class which constructs two Blocks, each with its own mass and velocity. For
this simulation, Block[0] is the first stationary block and Block[1] is the first moving block. In this
simulation, the velocity vectors are negative to the left and positive to the right, so Block[1] has an initially
negative velocity. I commented above all of the important lines, telling you what they do. You can also change some of
the variables to see the effects on the circle. When you run the program, after the blocks have finished colliding,
a graph will pop up.

 - Change the variables and see the effects.
